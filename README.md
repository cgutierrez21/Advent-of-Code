# Advent-of-Code
A place to keep track of progress in Advent of Code

## First time trying this since learning
- Let's see how much stuff has been left out of the learning material ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚
- To make things easier, I'm using CLion to create the project for each day and my main editor is Neovim ðŸ˜Ž
  (I've been using Neovim so much now that I wanted to do Advent of Code on CLion and I couldn't)
